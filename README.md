Demand Forecasting to optimize inventory in supermarket chain

This project forecasts daily demand for supermarket products using historical sales data. The Prophet time series model was used to predict future sales at product levels.

Project Overview

The project cleans and structures sales and product data, assigns products to categories, and aggregates daily sales. Demand patterns are explored through visualizations. The Prophet model is then used to forecast daily demand, first for a sample product and then for all products. Model accuracy is evaluated using standard metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).

Dataset:
The full dataset is not included in the public repository due to size limits. Instead, it has been uploaded to Google Drive: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160N9aRHFl056gvkfHhppmQmN2uYXNFIS?usp=sharing" 

Although the dataset consists of seven related files, only Sales, Categories, and Products files need to be downloaded to run the project successfully.
